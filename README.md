# JS-Button-Project
Javascript Button Action Examples
This project was to demonstrate how javascript and css implemts into a html page.
The Index.html is just a plain html page and the Index2.html has Bootstrap compiled in it.

*Please note the ending project on Codepen is from the index2.html due to Bootstrap.*

If you want to see the ending product to this project here is the link to my codepen ... https://codepen.io/PK_123/pen/apgLmE

In addition best practice is to create separate CSS and Javascript pages to Link them to main index.html page or .html page you are working on.
